# SWIM - A Simulator of Web Infrastructure and Management
SWIM is a self-adaptive exemplar that simulates a web application. SWIM can be used as a target system with an external adaptation manager interacting with it through its TCP-based interface or with an adaptation manager built as a simulation module.

## Proactively spawning servers using Machine Learning
The adaptation manager for our extension can be found [here](https://github.com/ChrisPetalotis/swim/blob/main/src/managers/adaptation/ProactiveAdaptationManager.cc). The knowledge changes can be found [here](https://github.com/ChrisPetalotis/swim/blob/main/src/model/Model.cc#L302) for the system related information and environment request arrival rate changes [here](https://github.com/ChrisPetalotis/swim/blob/main/src/model/Environment.h#L35). Changes made for the execution manager to spawn servers at the appropriate time are [here](https://github.com/ChrisPetalotis/swim/blob/main/src/managers/execution/ExecutionManagerModBase.cc#L116) and [here](https://github.com/ChrisPetalotis/swim/blob/main/src/managers/adaptation/ProactiveAdaptationManager.cc#L200).

## This version of swim cannot be containerized and run due to a Dockerfile error.
